    "Bio": "Kyo Kusanagi is the main protagonist in SNK's The King of Fighters video game series. He was first introduced in The King of Fighters '94 as the leader of the Japan team. He is the rival of Iori Yagami. (SNK Wiki)",
    "Gameplay": "Kyo is featured as the well rounded character that has all the fundamental tools to win. His exceptional ability to go on offense with a fast hop with a great downward hitting jump-in coupled with fast, low-hitting attacks that hitconfirm into knockdown combos makes his offensive game quite scary. As a contrast, he is also fitted with the tools to be able to keep out opponents with long reaching horizontal jumping attacks, projectiles, and great grounded normal attacks. He isn't the best in either fields but ranks high in either style of play and putting both playstyles together makes him to be force to be reckoned with. (Shoryuken Wiki)",
